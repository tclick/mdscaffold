"""Test suite initialization module for the $project.Name package.

This module marks the `tests` directory as a recognizable Python package. It establishes the root test namespace and
ensure proper test discovery, package isolation, and test-environment consistency across the entire test suite.

Notes
-----
While this initialization file remains sparse to maintain test isolation and prevent unintended side effects during
module collection, it acts as the baseline configuration entry point for test runners like `pytest` or `unittest`.

For advanced runtime fixtures, global test configuration hooks, or shared cross-module testing utilities, prefer
defining them inside a dedicated `conftest.py` file or a specialized `tests.helpers` submodule rather than adding
heavy executable logic directly within this package initializer.

Examples
--------
To discover and execute all unit, integration, and functional tests registered under this namespace, run the following
command from the root directory of the repository:

$ pytest tests/
